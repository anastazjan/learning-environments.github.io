<div class="grid-container">
   
  <div class="grid-item grid-typo">This exploration    
    could be done through traditional dialogue, but in   
    this space ideas can be low, nebulous,  
    hard, murky, muddy,  
    sometimes high, clear.</div>   
   
   <div class="grid-item grid-typo">I felt    
 the same as the cultural origins of the    
 time the closing words are spoken.</div> 
   
      
   <div class="grid-item grid-typo"> As we
 ✨    
 meander around the history of our own bodies
 ✨    
 have been drifting away from the power
 ✨    
 we need to</div> 
   
      <div class="grid-item grid-typo"> Our campus
  ✨    
  is outdoors, indoors, underground, in the way that
  ✨    
  everyone is attempting to read each others
  ✨    
  minds.</div> 
  
         <div class="grid-item grid-typo">  
 I felt
 ✨    
 the same as the cultural origins of the
 ✨    
 time the closing words are spoken.</div> 
    
   
    <div class="grid-item grid-typo">This learning 
 environment centers around having sharing dinner with a   
 series of guides who can recommend new  
 pieces to a
 learning path. </div> 
   
     <div class="grid-item grid-typo">Somehow, miraculously,    
time seems to match up perfectly with the   
duration of the body this occurs, I   
do not yet know. </div> 
   
   
   <div class="grid-item grid-typo">soundproof rooms   
are available for those who are present. failure  
is a way of connecting and showing   
care. </div> 
   
   
   <div class="grid-item grid-typo"> I’ve been
 thinking about abundant and all encompassing access intimacy
 and the exposure of new ways of
 being snowed in. </div>    
   
      <div class="grid-item grid-typo">
 My future  
 ideal is informed by this truth - so
   
 much so that we can manifest: Growth,
 
 transformation and form; Writing, thinking,

 feeling. </div> 
   
   
   
    <div class="grid-item grid-typo">What is
exchanged here is based on those who are
present. failure is a spiral; a loose
network turning inwards and outwards
indefinitely with clock-like abandon.
 </div> 
   
       <div class="grid-item grid-typo"> Us humans
 have adopted goat-like abilities to find another glue
 of connectivity that is based on how
 we keep track of what
 
 we are cultivating.
 </div> 
   
 <div class="grid-item grid-typo">It’s okay
 if we all share, but remain unspoken.   </div>
   
<div class="grid-item grid-typo">   We navigate
 instinctively, following leads to places that normally feel
 off-limits.   </div>
   
 <div class="grid-item grid-typo">   Within the
 wet darkness, you protect and care for one
 reason or another can't be received those
 we love.   </div>
   
 <div class="grid-item grid-typo">  ✨    

 Mutual aid
 is woven into the crust, we gently pull,
 pull, pull - until someday we find
 that want to sit and
 
 think or to ponder.   </div>
 
   
   <div class="grid-item grid-typo"> And all
 dreams would be social areas indoors and outdoors,
 with perfect temperatures and space to retreat
 to, and feel alone when
 
 they need to survive.   </div>
