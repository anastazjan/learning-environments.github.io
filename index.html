<h1> Learning environments</h1>
<p>This exploration    
    could be done through traditional dialogue, but in   
    this space ideas can be low, nebulous,  
    hard, murky, muddy,  
    sometimes high, clear. </p>
    
<p> I felt    
 the same as the cultural origins of the    
 time the closing words are spoken.
