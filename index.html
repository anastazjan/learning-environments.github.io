  <div class="grid-item grid-typo">This exploration    
    could be done through traditional dialogue, but in   
    this space ideas can be low, nebulous,  
    hard, murky, muddy,  
    sometimes high, clear.</div>   
   
   <div class="grid-item grid-typo">I felt    
 the same as the cultural origins of the    
 time the closing words are spoken.</div> 
   
      
   <div class="grid-item grid-typo"> As we
 ✨    
 meander around the history of our own bodies

 have been drifting away from the power

 we need to</div> 
   
      <div class="grid-item grid-typo"> Our campus
  ✨    
  is outdoors, indoors, underground, in the way that

 environment centers around having sharing dinner with a   
 series of guides who can recommend new  
 pieces to a
 learning path. </div>

time seems to match up perfectly with the   
duration of the body this occurs, I   
do not yet know. </div> 
   
   
   <div class="grid-item grid-typo">soundproof rooms   
are available for those who are present. failure  
is a way of connecting and showing   
care. </div>

 My future  
 ideal is informed by this truth - so
   
 much so that we can manifest: Growth,
 
 transformation and form; Writing, thinking,

 feeling. </div> 
   
   
   
    <div class="grid-item grid-typo">What is
exchanged here is based on those who are
present. failure is a spiral; a loose
network turning inwards and outwards
indefinitely with clock-like abandon.
